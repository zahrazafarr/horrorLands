# HorrorLands

##### The idea was to build a blog for horror fans to refer to-- keep track of your horror favorites all in one place, like one huge "bookmark tab". Instead of going on a million different pages to read articles, shop for collectibles, or hear about the next horror con, you can organize everything that interests you in one place in a personalized and fun way.


###### I struggled with linking jquery, and with making the media responsive. In the future, I'd like to be able to create what I initially wanted- being able to log in to your own account and share with others. I'd want the junkyard items to be automatically updated underneath their image if theyre sold out or not, better music page, etc etc
